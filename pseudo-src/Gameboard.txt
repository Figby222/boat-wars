Create Gameboard class
    3d array board

    place ships at specific coordinates
    by calling ship factory

    receiveAttack() takes coordinates [x, y]

    array of missed attacks

    check if boats have been sunk

    create function setBoard()
        set board to []
        for 0 < 10
            push [] to board


    create function placeBoat(boat, [x, y])
        set board[x][y] to boat
    
    create function receiveAttack(coordinates)
        deconstruct coordinates into x and y
        throw error of coordinates are out of bounds
        throw error if coordinates have already been hit
        if ship at coordinates call ship.hit on ship
        push coordinates to this.hits

Create Cell class
    constructor takes an arg "boat = null"
        set this.boat to boat
