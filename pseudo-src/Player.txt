create Player class
    Players can take turns playing the game
        by attacking the enemy Gameboard
    
    computer makes random plays, and
        doesn't hit the same spot twice
        
    create constructor(Gameboard)
        set this.gameboard to Gameboard
        set this.shotsArr to []
    
    create function shoot(player, coordinates)
        if stringified coordinates are in shotsArr
            throw error with message:
                "Cell already been shot"
        
        call player.receiveAttack(coordinates)
        push stringified coordinates to shotsArr

    or less coupled:
    create function shoot(coordinates)
        if stringified coordinates in shotsArr
            throw error with message:
                "Cell already been shot"
        push stringified coordinates to shotsArr
        return coordinates
